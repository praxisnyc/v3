		<h2>Brainbound</h2>
<div class="description fragment">
	<p>The (nonneural) body is just the sensor and effector system of the brain, and the world is just the arena in which adaptive problems get posed and in which the brain–body system must sense and act. </p>
<blockquote>All human cognition depends directly on neural activity alone.</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>Extended</h2>
	<div class="description fragment">
	<p>Includes inextricable tangles of feedback, feed-forward, and feed-around loops: loops that promiscuously criss-cross the boundaries of brain, body, and world. The local mechanisms of mind are not all in the head. </p>
<blockquote>Cognition leaks out into body and world.</blockquote>

<section>
	<h3>"This matters because it drives home the degree to which environmental engineering is also self-engineering."</h3>
</section>
<!--
<p>If such bodily and extrabodily loops are indeed integral to certain forms of intelligent activity, we need to understand when and why this can be so</p>

<p>to say that cognition is embodied means that it arises from bodily interactions with the world,</p>

<p>Mind, therefore, is not incidentally but intimately embodied and intimately embedded in its world.</p>
-->



<section>
	<h2>metabolic cost</h2>
<h3>energetic expenditure</h3>

<p>An ecological control system is one in which goals are not achieved by micromanaging every detail of the desired action or response but by making the most of robust, reliable sources of relevant order in the bodily or worldly environment of the controller.</p>
<p>Part of the “processing” is taken over by the dynamics of the agent-environment interaction, and only sparse neural control needs to be exerted when the self-regulating and stabilizing properties of the natural dynamics can be exploited.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>morphological computation</h2>

<p>Not all the processing is performed by the brain, but certain aspects of it are taken over by the morphology, materials, and environment [yielding] a ‘balance’ or task-distribution between the different aspects of an embodied agent</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>transparent equipment</h2>

<p>At this point, the extrabodily world becomes poised to present itself to the user not just as a problem space (though it is clearly that) but also as a problem-solving resource</p>

	<p>One way in which evolved agents truly inhabit, rather than simply control their bodies may be usefully understood in terms of a profound fit between morphology and control.</p>

</section>

<section>
	<h2>rapid saccades</h2>
<h3>spontaneous scanning eye movements</h3>

<p>Even when repeated saccades are made to the same site, very minimal information is retained. Instead, repeated fixations provide specific items of information “just in time” for use.</p>

<p>Eye movements, head movements, and memory load trade off against each other in a flexible way.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Principle of Ecological Assembly (PEA)</h2>
<p>The canny cognizer tends to recruit, on the spot, whatever mix of problem-solving resources will yield an acceptable result with a minimum of effort.</p>

<blockquote>The recruitment process marks no special distinction among neural, bodily, and environmental resources</blockquote>
</section>

<!-- <p>the embodiment level” to indicate the level at which functionally critical operations occur at timescales of around one-third second. This corresponds, nonaccidentally, to the observed frequency of saccades and is, the authors claim, the timescale at which “the natural sequentiality of body movements can be matched to the natural computational economies of sequential decision systems through a system of implicit reference (called deictic) in which pointing movements are used to bind objects in the world to cognitive programs</p>

<p>The embodied agent is empowered to use active sensing and perceptual coupling in ways that simplify neural problem solving by making the most of environmental opportunities and information freely available in the optic array.</p> -->

<section>
	<h2>Extentions as Amputations</h2>
<h3>Marshall McLuhan</h3>

<p>Any invention or technology is an extension or self-amputation of our physical bodies, and such extension also demands new ratios or new equilibriums among the other organs and extensions of the body.</p>
